## Features

- **Job Lifecycle Management**: Track jobs through various statuses, including `waiting`, `active`, `completed`, and `failed`.
- **Flexible Job Processors**: Define custom logic for processing jobs using simple functions.
- **Tooling**: Gedis debugger tool can be used to assist development.
- **Configurable Job Retention**: Control how many completed and failed jobs are stored.
- **Signals**: Emit signals on job completion and failure.
- **Pub/Sub Events**: Subscribe to job lifecycle events.

## Pub/Sub Events

GedisQueue uses Gedis's pub/sub functionality to broadcast events about the job lifecycle. You can subscribe to these events to monitor your queues in real-time.

The following events are published:

- `added`: When a new job is added to the queue.
- `active`: When a job is being processed.
- `progress`: When a job's progress is updated.
- `completed`: When a job has been completed successfully.
- `failed`: When a job has failed.

To subscribe to events, you can use the `subscribe` method on your Gedis instance:

```gdscript
signal psub_message(pattern, channel, message)

var gedis = Gedis.new()
var queue = GedisQueue.new()

func _ready():
    add_child(gedis)

    queue.setup(gedis)
    add_child(queue)

    gedis.psubscribe("gedis_queue:my_queue:events:*", self)
    pubsub_message.connect(_on_job_completed)

func _on_job_completed(pattern, channel, message):
    prints(pattern, channel, message)
```

## Configuration

You can configure GedisQueue to control job retention and other settings.

- `max_completed_jobs`: The maximum number of completed jobs to keep. Set to `0` to delete jobs immediately after completion, or `-1` to keep all completed jobs.
- `max_failed_jobs`: The maximum number of failed jobs to keep. Set to `0` to delete jobs immediately after failure, or `-1` to keep all failed jobs.

```gdscript
var queue = GedisQueue.new()
queue.max_completed_jobs = 100 # Keep the last 100 completed jobs
queue.max_failed_jobs = 50    # Keep the last 50 failed jobs
```

## Installation

To use GedisQueue, you need to have the Gedis addon installed and enabled in your Godot project. You can download Gedis from the Godot Asset Library or from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NodotProject/Gedis).

Once Gedis is set up, install the GedisQueue addon by copying the contents of the `addons/GedisQueue` directory into your project's `addons` folder. Then, enable the "GedisQueue" plugin in your Project Settings.

## Usage

### Creating a Queue

To get started, you need to create an instance of the `GedisQueue` class. It's recommended to add it to your scene tree as an autoloaded singleton for easy access throughout your project.

```gdscript
# In your main script or an autoloaded singleton
var queue = GedisQueue.new()

# Optionally pass your existing gedis instance
# queue.setup(my_gedis_instance)

add_child(queue)
```

### Adding Jobs

You can add a job to a queue using the `add` method. Each job is identified by a unique ID and can carry any data you need. For example, you could add a job to grant a player a daily reward.

```gdscript
var job = queue.add("player_rewards", {
    "player_id": "player123",
    "reward_type": "daily_login_bonus",
    "items": ["gold_coins", "health_potion"],
    "quantity": [100, 2]
})

print("Reward job added with ID: ", job.id)
```

### Processing Jobs

To process jobs, you need to define a worker that executes your custom logic. The `process` method takes a queue name and a processor function as arguments. This function will handle the logic for granting the reward.

```gdscript
var processor = func(job):
    var reward_data = job.data
    var player = get_player(reward_data.player_id)
    print("Granting reward to: ", player.name)
    
    for i in range(reward_data.items.size()):
        player.inventory.add_item(reward_data.items[i], reward_data.quantity[i])
        
    job.complete("Reward granted successfully")

var worker = queue.process("player_rewards", processor)
```

The processor function receives the job as an argument and is responsible for calling `job.complete()` or `job.fail()` to finish the job.

### Job Lifecycle

You can monitor the status of jobs using the `get_jobs` method. This allows you to retrieve jobs in different states, such as `waiting`, `active`, `completed`, or `failed`. This is useful for tracking game events.

```gdscript
# Get all completed reward jobs
var completed_jobs = queue.get_jobs("player_rewards", [GedisQueue.STATUS_COMPLETED])
for job in completed_jobs:
    print("Job %s completed with result: %s" % [job.id, job.return_value])

# Get all failed jobs
var failed_jobs = queue.get_jobs("player_rewards", [GedisQueue.STATUS_FAILED])
for job in failed_jobs:
    print("Job %s failed with error: %s" % [job.id, job.failed_reason])
```

### Batch Processing

GedisQueueWorker supports batch processing, allowing you to process multiple jobs concurrently. This can significantly improve performance when dealing with a large number of jobs.

The `batch_size` public variable on the `GedisQueueWorker` controls how many jobs are processed at once. The default value is `1`, meaning jobs are processed one by one.

```gdscript
var worker = queue.process("player_rewards", processor)
worker.batch_size = 10 # Process up to 10 jobs at a time
```

## Breaking Changes & Migration Guide

With the latest update, the way job completion is handled has been refactored for greater flexibility. Previously, the processor function would return a value to signal completion. Now, you must explicitly call `job.complete()` or `job.fail()` within your processor.

This change allows for more complex scenarios, such as asynchronous operations, where the job might not be completed within the initial function call.

### Before

```gdscript
var processor = func(job):
    # ... some logic ...
    if success:
        return "Job completed successfully"
    else:
        return "Job failed" # This was not ideal for handling failures
```

### After

```gdscript
var processor = func(job):
    # ... some logic ...
    if success:
        job.complete("Job completed successfully")
    else:
        job.fail("Something went wrong")
```
